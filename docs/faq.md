# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Kubernetes Volume Controller (KVC)

### I have a comment, question, feedback, concern or enhancement request. What should I do?
File an [issue][issues].

### I want a feature X but Kubernetes does not provide it. Does KVC offer feature X?
KVC does not offer feature X :). KVC uses existing features in Kubernetes to provide basic volume
and data management. If a feature is not available in Kubernetes, we don't
provide it. In the future, if feature X is available in Kubernetes and it is
relevant to KVC, we will adapt the feature.
